# Planification
Here are the codes I developped during my internship at ISAE-SUPAERO in 2020. My research project was to implement a new optimization criterion, initially created by C. Chanel and Y. Watanabe, in stochastic shortest path problems (SSP) with Dead-Ends. Those codes essentially helped me to understand the approach I had to implement and also Planification.
